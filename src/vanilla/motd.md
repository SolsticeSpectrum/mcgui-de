MOTD is the description of the server shown in the server list as shown in the image below.

If you want to use Vanilla MOTD (MOTD set in `server.properties`), you need to use special color codes to apply colors, which can be found at [this link](https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php).

However, you can also use a MOTD plugin that offers more features, such as dynamic MOTD, HEX (RGB) color support, or text next to the icon (on the left), as shown in the image below. MOTD plugins also have a feature for dynamic (or fake playercount) and showing custom text on hover.
