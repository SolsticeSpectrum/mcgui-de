# Datapacks {#datapacks}
A datapack allows you to change the default or add new game behavior. Datapacks are a Vanilla feature, so they can be used on all platforms, including modded ones.

However, if possible, it is recommended to use a plugin or mod instead of a datapack. The Paper Tweaks plugin is a great replacement for VanillaTweaks datapacks.

## Installation {#datapack-installation}
The datapack can be installed by uploading the datapack to `/mainWorld/datapacks/`. The main world is the world set in `server.properties` at `level-name` (*world* by default). After uploading the datapack, just restart the server. You can check if the datapack is running by executing the `datapack list` command.

If the server version is lower than 1.13, datapacks cannot be used as they were added to the game in this version.

When installing a datapack, make sure you are downloading a datapack version compatible with the server version!

Often the datapack is a `.zip` file that needs to be extracted (= unzipped). In this case, the downloaded file probably has a name like `Some_Datapack_UNZIP_ME.zip`). After unzipping, you will then have extracted folder in the `/datapacks/` directory. After that you can delete the `.zip` file. However, a datapack can also be a `.zip` file, so only extract when instruction to do so is given.
