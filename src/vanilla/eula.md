# EULA {#eula}
[EULA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_User_License_Agreement) (end-user license agreement) is a license for the end user of software that specifies what the user can and cannot do.

The full Minecraft EULA can be found at the following link: <https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula>

If the EULA is violated, the Minecraft server may be blocked, which is a risk especially for large servers. Violations of some parts of the EULA are generally tolerated by Mojang, while others are not. However, there is no guarantee that this will remain the case. Violating EULA is also not tolared by some people and communities.

## EULA confirmation {#eula-accept}
In order to run a Minecraft server, you must agree to the Minecraft EULA. This can easily be done by setting the value of `eula` from `false` to `true` in the `eula.txt` file, which is located in the server [root directory](~root-directory).
