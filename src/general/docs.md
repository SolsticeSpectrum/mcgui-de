# Documentation {#docs}
The documentation contains information about the platform/plugin/mods, specifically their functions, instructions, and for plugins [commands](commands.md#commands), [permissions](permissions.md#permissions), or [placeholders](./plugins/placeholders.md#placeholders), etc. You can almost always find a link to it on the project page from where you download the plugin/platform.

If you don't know your way around a particular setting, the documentation is where you should look first.

As with configuration files, you can search in browser in text (keywords), which can make searching easier. Just use the *Ctrl + F*  shortcut to enable text search. The documentation page often provides search function too.
