# Spigot identifiers {#spigot-ids}
Spigot has special identifiers for item names, effects, mobs, etc., which don't always match the Minecraft ones.

A list of these identifiers can be needed in the moment you're working with them in configuration. Most often people encounter these identifiers when working with DeluxeMenus - <https://wiki.helpch.at/helpchat-plugins/deluxemenus/options-and-configurations/item>

These identifiers are for example:

- items

- potion effects

<https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html>

- entities

<https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html>

- item flags (item properties)

These are item properties like hiding enchants

- effects

<https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Effect.html>

- sounds

<https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Sound.html>

It's important to keep in mind that these names are specific to the version of Spigot, so always search the list corresponding to your version of the server, which you can easily find using Google. (Google â†’ "Spigot 1.12.2 material list" etc.).
