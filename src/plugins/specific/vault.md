# Vault Plugin {#vault}
As it says in the description on the [plugin page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) - "Vault is a Permissions, Chat, & Economy API to give plugins easy hooks into these systems without needing to hook or depend on each individual plugin themselves.."

If you want to [display prefixes](../prefixes.md) on a player server, or if you use an economy on a server, install Vault, because you will almost certainly need it.

Although the plugin hasn't been updated in years, it's fine. The plugin works on newer versions without any issues.

To use [placeholder](../placeholders.md#placeholders) for money/prefix, if you have Vault installed, you can use Vault placeholders see [list of them here](https://wiki.placeholderapi.com/users/placeholder-list/#vault).

You can learn more about Vault [here](../economy.md).
