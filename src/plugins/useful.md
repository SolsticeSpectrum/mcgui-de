# List of useful/frequently used features {#plugins-useful}
Below is a list of the most frequently requested features.

## Permissions {#permissions}
Permissions, in simple terms, determine "what is allowed to do what". You can learn more about them [here](../general/permissions.md#permissions).

## Economy {#economy}
You can read more about the economy and plugins that use it (especially shops) [here](economy.md#economy).

## Prefixes {#prefixes}
You can read more about how to set up prefixes [here](prefixes.md#prefixes).

## EssentialsX {#essentialsx}
EssentialsX contains a number of basic server features, such as homes, warps, kits, and so on. However, some people prefer to use individual plugins as EssentialsX provide many unnecessary features they won't use.

## World Pregeneration {#pregeneration}
To [pregenerate](../general/pregeneration.md#pregeneration) a world, use [Chunky](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky) plugin.

## Placeholders {#placeholders}
In case you want to display dynamic info (like amount of money, current time, number of kills, ...) in a tab or scoreboard, you can achieve that using placeholders. You can learn more about them [here](placeholders.md#placeholders).

## Customizing tab, scoreboard (or nametag) {#tab-scoreboard}
In case you want to customize tab, create scoreboard, or edit nametag (e.g. add a prefix next to a player's name) or even a bossbar, the best solution is to use the [TAB](https://modrinth.com/plugin/tab-was-taken) plugin (by NEZNAMY), which has everything you need and also provides excellent documentation.

## Multiversion support {#multiversion-support}
In case you want to allow connections from a different version than the server version, ViaVersion plugin (and its addons) can be useful. You can learn more about it [here](specific/viaversion.md#viaversion).

## World management {#world-management}
If you need a plugin to manage multiple worlds, you can use the [Multiverse-Core](specific/multiverse-core.md#multiverse-core) plugin, which also allows you to configure many aspects of the worlds (e.g. disabling mobs, changing difficulty, setting world respawn world and location, etc.).

## Player action logging {#player-action-logging}
The [CoreProtect](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/coreprotect.8631/) is the standard for logging player actions for many years. The plugin allows you to rollback these actions.

## Bedrock player support {#bedrock-players-support}
The [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) plugin, together with Floodgate, allows connection of players with Bedrock edition of the game.

## Punishments (bans) {#ban-system}
If you need more sophisticated punishment system than what Vanilla provides, the [LibertyBans](https://modrinth.com/plugin/libertybans/) plugin is an ideal open-source alternative.

## Land protection {#land-protection}
To protect "server" regions (e.g. spawn), the most commonly used plugin is WorldGuard (WG basics can be found [here](specific/worldguard.md#worldguard))

For protecting player builds, the most commonly used plugins are Residence (can be downloaded for free), GriefPrevention, and Lands (paid).
