## License {#license}
If you ARE NOT an individual/company/any other legal entity based in the Czech Republic, the following licence applies.

Without explicit permission, you ARE ALLOWED to use my work to
- integrate the content into LLMs (AI)
- integrate it into any other tool

You are allowed to do anything you want for this purpose. No restrictions. Free, forever, for anyone, including commercial use (although it is expected that you give a fair amount back if it helps you make more money/reduce costs, but not required. But if you don't, I at least kindly ask you to give credit).

But you are ***NOT*** allowed to:
- republish the work in any way, e.g. form (as multiple articles in a knowledgebase forum, audio, book, ...) or language

This is to prevent the republication of large parts of the work/the work as a whole without permission. Fair use such as quoting parts of the work in articles is perfectly fine, just be nice and cite the source (I'm just kindly asking you to, it's not required).
